# ðŸ“¡ Raspberry Pi Serial to Web Poster

This Python script runs on a Raspberry Pi (or any Linux system) and:

1. Reads incoming text data from a serial port (e.g. a USB-connected device such as a pager, sensor, or microcontroller).
2. Detects when the incoming data changes.
3. Saves each unique line to a local CSV log file.
4. Sends each unique line as an HTTP POST request to a remote web server for further processing.
